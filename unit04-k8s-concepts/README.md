# Unit 4: Kubernates Concepts
In this lecture we will discuss about Kubernetes PODs.

## Pods
![Pods](./images/pods-1.jpg)
* With kubernetes our ultimate aim is to deploy our application in the form of containers on a set of machines that are configured as worker nodes in a cluster.
* However, kubernetes does not deploy containers directly on the worker nodes. The containers are encapsulated into a Kubernetes object known as PODs.
* A POD is a single instance of an application. 
* A POD is the smallest object, that you can create in kubernetes.

* Here we see the simplest of simplest cases were you have a single node kubernetes cluster with a single instance of your application running in a single docker container encapsulated in a POD.
* If the number of users accessing your application increase and you need to scale your application, You need to add additional instances of your web application to share the load.
* To scale up, we create a new POD altogether with a new instance of the same application. 
* As you can see we now have two instances of our web application running on two separate PODs on the same kubernetes system or node.
* If the user base FURTHER increases and your current node has no sufficient capacity, THEN you can always deploy additional PODs on a new node in the cluster. You will have a new node added to the cluster to expand the clusterâ€™s physical capacity.
* You do not add additional containers to an existing POD to scale your application.
